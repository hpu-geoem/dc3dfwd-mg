# Model files

The model files include the mesh file and the resistivity file. The mesh file
has to be end with extension of `tria` and can be generated by Python scripts
provided in the examples directory. The mesh file is a binary file containing
the mesh information. Each cell in the mesh has a `material_id` property, which
is used to assign the resistivity value to the cell.

The resistivity file has extension of `.rho` and contains the resistivity values
of the cells in the mesh. The file is a text file. The first line contains an
integer N, the number of unique resistivity values. The following N lines
contain the resistivity values. The resistivity values are in Ohm-m.

The following is an example of a resistivity file:
